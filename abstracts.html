      <p>Nonequilibrium Neural Computation: Stochastic thermodynamics of the asymmetric Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
    </p>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
            Effective neural information processing entails flexible architectures integrating multiple sensory streams that vary in time with internal and external events. Physically, neural computation is, in a thermodynamic sense, an out-of-equilibrium, non-stationary process that changes dynamically giving rise to entropy production. Cognitively, neural activity results in dynamic changes in sensory streams and internal states. In contrast, classical neuroscience theory focuses on stationary, equilibrium information paradigms (e.g., efficient coding theory), which often fail to describe the role of nonequilibrium fluctuations in neural processes. In consequence, there is a pressing demand for mathematical tools to understand the dynamics of large-scale, non-equilibrium networks systems and to analyse high-dimensional datasets recorded from them. Inspired by the success of the equilibrium Ising model in investigating disordered systems in the thermodynamic limit, we study the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the asymmetric Sherrington-Kirkpatrick system with both synchronous and asynchronous updates as a prototypical model of large-scale nonequilibrium networks. We employ a path integral method to calculate a generating functional over the trajectories to derive exact solutions of the order parameters, conditional entropy of trajectories, and steady-state entropy production of infinitely large networks. Inspecting the system's phase diagram, we find that the entropy production peaks at a critical order-disorder phase transition, but it is more prominent outside the critical regime, especially at disordered phases with low entropy rates. While entropy production is becoming popular to characterize various complex systems, our results reveal that increased entropy production is linked with radically different scenarios.  Combining multiple thermodynamic quantities  yields a more precise picture of different temporally irreversible spiking patterns. These results contribute to an understanding of the distinct roles in neural computation in the light of an exact analytical theory of the thermodynamics of large-scale nonequilibrium systems and their phase transitions.

            Uncanny communicators: the coming age of Social AI
            Since the launch of ChatGPT in November last year, there has been growing public awareness that generative AI will soon have massive impacts on our professional lives. What is less widely recognised, however, is the pervasive influence that AI will soon have on our social and romantic lives. Or so I argue in this talk. Beginning with a survey of existing social, conversational, and romantic applications of generative AI, I argue that deep features of human cognition and 21st social arrangements make it highly likely that AI friendships and romantic partnerships will become commonplace in many societies around the world before the end of the decade. After considering and responding to some sceptical doubts about this suggestion, I go on to survey some of the ethical and political concerns - from social deskilling to commodification of relationships – raised by this new stage in the development of human-AI interactions, and argue that we should begin planning for these as soon as possible.

          <p>Neuronal sensitivity to multiple task variables induced in the mouse somatosensory and associative cortex</p>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
            To explore how cortical neuronal activity underpins sequence discrimination, we recently developed a task in which mice distinguished between tactile sequences constructed from segments assembled in different orders and delivered to the animal’s whiskers. Animals licked to report the presence of a target sequence (GO/NOGO design). We recorded and manipulated cortical activity with two-photon imaging and optogenetics while mice performed the task. We expected that learning the task would induce neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1bf) to refine their sensory tuning, becoming more selective to the target GO sequence. Instead, two-photon imaging showed that, upon learning, neurons in both S1bf and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) became sensitive to multiple task variables, including sensory input but also the animal’s action decision (goal-directed licking) and the trial’s outcome (presence or absence of a predicted reward). While S1bf was necessary for sequence discrimination, PPC was not. Contrary to expectation, classifiers trained on the activity of S1bf neurons discriminated the animal’s decision on a trial (lick vs no lick) better than the sensory identity of the trial (GO vs NOGO), while classifiers trained on PPC neurons discriminated sensory information better than actions. Our results demonstrate that conditioning on a goal-directed sensory discrimination task results in neurons within S1bf whose activity reflects the learnt links between target stimulus and licking. They also show that PPC contains copies of task-relevant information even while playing no causal role in the animal’s performance. 
            These results and others from multiple sensory areas of cortex challenge the traditional neuroscience textbook view in which sensory and motor function are seen as separate areas of enquiry: classic work on anaesthetised animals was interpreted to suggest that sensory pathways provide a general-purpose representation of the environment, independent of decision-making and action. Instead, sensory cortex may be involved in task-specific processing and – as a consequence – an animal may not sense the world independently of its current behavioural goal. I will discuss possible roles of task-dependent S1bf activity.

              <h1>Multimodal units extract comodulated information</h1>
              <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
                We continuously detect sensory data, like sights and sounds, and use this information to guide our behaviour. However, rather than relying on single sensory channels, which are noisy and can be ambiguous alone, we merge information across our senses and leverage this combined signal. In biological networks, this process (multisensory integration) is implemented by multimodal neurons which are thought to receive the information accumulated by unimodal areas, and to fuse this across channels; an algorithm we term accumulate-then-fuse. However, is implementing this algorithm their main function? Here, we explore this question by developing novel multimodal tasks and deploying probabilistic and spiking neural network models. Using these models we demonstrate that multimodal units are not necessary for accuracy or balancing speed/accuracy in classical multimodal tasks, but are critical in a novel set of tasks in which we comodulate signals across channels. We show that these comodulation tasks require multimodal units to implement an alternative fuse-then-accumulate algorithm, and we demonstrate that this algorithm excels in naturalistic settings like predator-prey interactions. Ultimately, our work suggests that multimodal neurons are critical for extracting comodulated information, and provides novel tasks and models for exploring this in biological systems.

        <h1>Consciousness, neural complexity and integrated information
</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
          Understanding the fundamental physical substrate of consciousness is sometimes considered the final frontier of science. Here the integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT) is unprecedentedly ambitious in that it proposes a universal mathematical formula, derived from fundamental properties of conscious experience, to describe the quality and quantity of consciousness for any physical system that possesses it. However, in the current formulation, IIT formulae are not always well-defined and empirical results do not support the level of specificity present in the theory. In this talk, I give (i) an accessible overview of the key features and problems with IIT; (ii) discuss exciting empirical motivation for a weaker, less prescriptive, form of IIT. This ‘weak IIT’ retains the key hypothesis that neural activity associated with consciousness should exhibit a form of ‘dynamical complexity’ whereby there are lots of interactions between regions, and yet each region has distinct and rich dynamics.
